Welcome to the medicine bot!
Just search for a medicine and get the nearest location of availability of that medicine!
These medicines may not only be found in the pharmacies and hospitals around you, but also in your neighbourhood.
Worry not, for the medicines you are about to "take" from your next-door homebody is tractable by you from the billing information
he shows.

That's not all, why fret about throwing away extra medicine when you can be the headspring of some such service too?
Join our initiative to share medicines which is otherwise is unused or thrown after expiry.

All you need to do is tell your pharmacy guy that you want to help out this way and he, in turn will upload your medicine details
to our system.

"Commeth the hour, cometh the man!"
When someone needs the medicine you have, your location is shared. You, then, may tell if you still have the medicine you agreed
to share or if its out-of-stock.
If you still nurture the idea of sharing, confirm your availability to that peerson and show the medicine-detail bill message
when he drops by!

Say, you're on the receiving end of the system, you also may drop a message here asking for a medicine, locations of the people
having these messages will be shown.
If no one has your medicine, locations of pharmacies and hospitals near you are given at the least.
